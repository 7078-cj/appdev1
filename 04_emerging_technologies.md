# On Emerging Technologies: Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data.

## Purpose

The purpose of machine learning is to figure out how we can build computer systems that improve over time and with repeated use. This can be done by figuring out the fundamental laws that govern such learning processes.

## Usage

### In IT

the use of machine learning algorithms has many benefits. Systems that are based on this type of algorithm are more versatile and are capable of working in changing environments and adapting to them. You can perform tasks and solve problems related to computer vision, robotics and data analysis, among many others, which, until the appearance of these algorithms, was unthinkable. All this makes machine learning applications a great ally of Industry 4.0 when it comes to automating processes.:

 - **Quality systems**: machine learning algorithms create models that allow, for example, to detect defects in parts. Surface type defects in manufacturing, painting, etc. They also allow quality checks in an assembly process, presence or absence of parts, inspect welds, etc.

 - **Production**: in production, vision systems and robotics are combined with machine learning algorithms to improve processes and increase productivity. It is possible to automate tasks with variability that a traditional robot could not carry out by itself: recognizing and locating types of parts, processes and variable paths, etc. This allows in many cases to reduce costs and increase the competitiveness of companies.

 - **Machine maintenance and predictive maintenance**: by analyzing data (of any type) obtained from the different machines, models can be generated that are capable of predicting when a failure will occur. This serves to improve processes and prevent failures before machines break down. Avoid downtime in production and reduce preventive maintenance times.

### In Education

Machine learning in education transforms the learning process and gives new tools for educational institutions to track and improve students' performance and engagement. The ML-enabled personalized approach helps to make education more inclusive, accessible, and engaging:

- For **Adaptive learning**, ML-based predictive data analytics helps cater to the unique needs of every student. This technology has been implemented into several eLearning software solutions to monitor various parameters (such as exercise completion time, time spent on the platform, number of logins, and test results) and assess student performance, engagement, and learning patterns, or even forecast learning outcomes.
With the help of ML, adaptive platforms such as MobyMax, SchooLinks, Carnegie Learning's LiveLab, and Kidaptive can adjust individual learning activities in real-time or help teachers and students plan personalized curricula. Similar tools can deliver special educational programs for students affected by specific conditions, such as autism.

## Examples

### In Education

- **DUOLINGO**
<br>
-To help staff and contributors work more efficiently, Duolingo implemented a logistic regression model that scores reports based on word-level features:
Single words and two-word chunks (e.g., spotting obvious typos like “a apple”).
Comparison features between reported answers and accepted translations
This model ranks learner reports so that the most likely valid reports are surfaced first, saving valuable review time.

### In IT

- **GMAIL**
<br>
-"Simply put, to protect users at scale, we rely on machine learning powered by user feedback to catch spam and help us identify patterns in large data sets—making it easier to adapt quickly to ever-changing spam tactics. Gmail employs a number of AI-driven filters that determine what gets marked as spam".
